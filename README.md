# Time Series Analysis With Keras

The LSTM in an incredible ML archetecture that allows a neural net to retain 'memory'. In this project I use a historic S&P 500 data to train an LSTM to predict the future movements of the time series. 


#### Next Steps
The next step is to clean the all the csv files and then test my new network against the one built by [Jakob Aungiers](https://github.com/jaungiers). 

#### Credits
This project builds on the on a youtube tutorial by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell) and some helper code by [Jakob Aungiers](https://github.com/jaungiers) who demonstrated how to create a model with one feature. I build on this by pre-processing more historical data and increasing the number of features from one to five.
