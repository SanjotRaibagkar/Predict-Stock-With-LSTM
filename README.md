# Time Series Analysis With Keras

The LSTM is an incredible ML archetecture that is renowned for it's ability to learn long term dependences, amking it extremely effective with time-series data. In this project I use historic S&P 500 stock data to train an LSTM to predict the future closing price of the stock for a given time.


#### Next Steps
*clean up spx_from_1950.csv, as it has a few null values.
*test my new network against the one built by [Jakob Aungiers](https://github.com/jaungiers) to assess efficacy of the extra features 

#### Credits
This project builds on the on a youtube tutorial by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell) and some helper code by [Jakob Aungiers](https://github.com/jaungiers) who demonstrated how to create a model with one feature. I build on this by pre-processing more historical data and increasing the number of features from one to five.
